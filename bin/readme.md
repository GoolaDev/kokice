# bin folder

This is where you put binaries. For now only **[mpv.exe](https://mpv.io/installation/)** in case of Windows os.

For Linux users install mpv and a web server the ususal way. Missing mpv.exe from this folder implies
running under Linux. In this case you can delete QuickPHP and leave this folder empty.
PHP has built in web server for development purposes.
(You can run it like this, go to ./kokice/web and excute php --server localhost:8080 --docroot .)
